### quickstart
1. Download the [zip archive](https://github.com/monolithpl/examples-finder-windows/archive/master.zip)
2. Unpack to directory of choice
3. That's it! Run ```examples-finder.exe``` (tested on all versions of Windows)

### compiling from source
1. You'll need Borland Delphi 7+ (importing the project into FreePascal Lazarus also works fine but produces code that's sluggish and bloated)
2. The components you'll need to install are included in the ```components``` folder
3. That's it!
